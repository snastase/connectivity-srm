# Connectivity-based shared response model
This repo accompanies a manuscript currently in preparation by Samuel A. Nastase, Kenneth A. Norman, and Uri Hasson. Following the logic of connectivity hyperalignment (Guntupalli et al., 2018), we leverage intersubject functional correlations (ISFCs; Simony et al., 2016) to estimate a single connectivity-based shared response model (SRM; Chen et al., 2015) across disjoint datasets.
